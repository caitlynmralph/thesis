You could make all the likely comparisons to punk bands of the '70s — Ramones, Iggy Pop and The Stooges — or even bring up the new-school garage-rock undertones of The Strokes and The Strange Boys. But that would sell the band short. If anything, it combines the best elements of both genres: raw guitar chords and energy, plus DIY sentiment, but with hi-fi production. - NPR

Candid,"Hailing from the frozen bit of hell that is Syracuse, New York, the boys of Candid spew a buzzing brand of rock that is equal parts youthful spark and upstate bitterness. The band cites influences that run the gamut, from Weezer's unstoppable melodies and the soaring atmosphere of Radiohead to Elvis Costello's sharp lyrical jabs and the gritty intimacy of Ani DiFranco. 

In their six years as a band, Candid has developed an intensely loyal following that thrives on long nights and a strong sense of community. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Candid"">Read more on Last.fm</a>"

Deadstring Brothers began in fall 2003. Since then, the band has worked to develop their own take on the American Sound, drawing influences from a variety of sources. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Deadstring+Brothers"">Read more on Last.fm</a>"

Dead Coast,"The band’s music is so captivating especially the melody in each track. This is a band you must check out if you like retro psychedelic garage rock. (The Musical Junkie).

The sound is reminiscent to the swinging ’60s, with easy comparisons to a heavier and more hallucinogenic version of The Beatles in their early days (Bring the Noise UK).

Their music would work perfectly as a soundtrack to a Quentin Tarantino film, with a laid-back quality that cruised from one song to the next, in a locomotion that emulated the movement of waves. <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/dead+coast"">Read more on Last.fm</a>"

Eight Legs,"Despite being either 21 (singer and guitarist Sam Jolly, drummer Jack Garside) or 22 (bassist Adam Neil and guitarist Jack Wharton), there is a melancholy to Eight Legs that evokes experience rather than innocence. Songs like Climb the Walls and These Grey Days speak of parties that ended in drunken disaster, text message arguments between estranged young couples, and even that perennial rock and roll topic, boredom.

Yeh Deadlies,"Yeh Deadlies are an oddball troupe plying mashed-up rockabilly-inflected pop. The band is comprised of ex-members of (retards), B.S.O.B.K., and too many other acts to mention.

Most would agree, however, that The Never Beginning Story displays a wide range of styles and despite the simple nature of each song <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Yesan+Damen"">Read more on Last.fm</a>"
